    "# EDS232 Lab 1: Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lab, we will introduce the basics of machine learning in **Python** with **regression** algorithms, a core technique used to predict continuous outcomes. We will use the popular **scikit-learn** library, which provides easy-to-use tools for building and evaluating machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will learn how regression algorithms can help us model and predict water quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of regression a\n",
    "- Implement regression models in Python\n",
    "- Evaluate model performance using  **R²** and **MSE**\n",
    "- Visualize regression prediction results \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression**: A machine learning method for predicting continuous values.\n",
    "  - **Simple Linear Regression**: A regression model with one independent variable.\n",

    "  \n",
    "- **Scikit-learn**: A Python library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and machine learning. We will use it for:\n",

    "Hurricane Irene caused extensive flood and wind damage as it traveled across the Caribbean and up the East coast of the United States.  The Hurricane made landfall in the United States near Cape Lookout, North Carolina on August 27th, 2011 and was downgraded to a Tropical Storm by the time it hit the New York City region on Sunday, August 28th, 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset from the Hudson River Environmental Conditions Observing System (HRECOS) offers a detailed look at the effects of Hurricane Irene on the river's ecosystem through high-frequency, 15-minute interval measurements over a ten-day period. It includes variables critical to understanding ecological health, such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, depth, and meteorological data like rainfall and wind speed. Analyzing these variables helps answer questions about how extreme weather events like hurricanes can disrupt river ecosystems and impact water quality.\n",

    "Turbidity levels in water can be significantly affected by major weather events such as hurricanes. Turbidity measures how much light is blocked by particles in water. In an event like a hurricane, we expect wind and rainfall to bring in suspended particles, increasing the turbidity of the water. When light is blocked by particles in water, oxygen production is impacted as well. When a natural disaster like a hurricane alters turbidity levels in a body of water, how is dissolved oxygen  impacted? Let's find out. \n",

Store the result in the `df` variable. Drop the columns that contain data for Piedmont, as Piedmont does not contain any turbidity data. We are only interested in the Port of Albany and Norrie Point for this lab. \n",
