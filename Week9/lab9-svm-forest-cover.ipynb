    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs) for multi-class classification using cartographic variables. Specifically, we will predict forest cover type based on a variety of environmental features such as elevation, soil type, and land aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding forest cover classification is crucial for natural resource management. Land managers and conservationists rely on accurate predictions of vegetation types to make informed decisions about wildlife habitats, fire management, and sustainable forestry practices. However, direct field assessments of forest cover can be costly and time-consuming, making predictive models a valuable tool for estimating cover types in large or inaccessible regions.\n",

    "### Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning for SVM\n",
    "To optimize our SVM model, we need to search for the best hyperparameters that maximize classification accuracy. Since SVM performance depends heavily on `C`, `kernel`, and `gamma`, we will use `GridSearchCV()` to systematically test different combinations. Initialize a cross validation object with 5 folds using `StratifiedKFold`. Check out how `StratifiedKFold` differs from `Kfold` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html). \n",
