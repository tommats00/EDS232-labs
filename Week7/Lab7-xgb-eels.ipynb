    "In this lab, you will model the distribution of the eel species *Anguilla australis* using **boosted classification trees (BCTs)**, a machine learning technique that improves predictive performance by combining multiple decision trees. Elith et al. (2008) offered an early implementation of BRTs in an ecological setting to understand how environmental variables influence eel distribution.\n",

    "2. **Evaluation Data** – Used to assess model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "- Train and fine-tune an **XGBoost** model for classification of species presence/absence data.\n",
    "- Compare your model’s performance to the approach used by Elith et al.\n",

    "Let's get started by preparing our data. `Angaus` will be our target variable(`y`), and all other variables will be our features (`X`). Then encode the categorical feature using `LabelEncoder()`. The final step will be a bit different this time.  We don't need to split off testing data for the final model evaluation; a separate set (`eval_data`) will be used as in Elith et al.  We do, however, need to split our data in order to do the early stopping process. When splitting your data into training and validation, use a test size of 0.2 and a random state of 808. "

Instead of testing every possible value, this method samples a set number of candidates (`n_iter`) from a defined parameter distribution.  In this case, sampling 20 candidates from a uniform distribution between `0.01` and `0.31`. Check out the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.uniform.html) on `scipy.stats.uniform` to see how it differs from `random.uniform`.
